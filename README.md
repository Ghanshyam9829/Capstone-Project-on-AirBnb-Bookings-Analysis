# Capstone-Project-on-AirBnb-Bookings-Analysis
We will give the analysis of airbnb bookings data for better business growth and customer satisfaction


# Project Summary -
As we know about airbnb, this is an online site that introduces the property owner to the tenant and the tenant to the property owner, so we have been given a data set related to that, in which mostly we have been given information about the property. Yes, now using this information, we will answer some such questions which will be beneficial for our airbnb business.By analyzing the given data set, we are going to estimate, which facility is available at where, for how long, what is its cost, and can we make some changes in it, such as the room type given to us. There are three types of room types in the set, we will analyze these three and will also give arguments to increase the business with a reasonable estimate.
