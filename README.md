Yes, now using this information, we will answer some such questions which will be beneficial for our airbnb business.By analyzing the given data set, we are going to estimate, which facility is available at where, for how long, what is its cost, and can we make some changes in it, such as the room type given to us. There are three types of room types in the set, we will analyze these three and will also give arguments to increase the business with a reasonable estimate.

# Solution to Business Objective

### 1. By the analysis of 1st chart we know the count of different types of rooms available. We can see that the no. of shared rooms is very less. Therefore, shared room listing should be increased to enhance sales.

### 2.From the second graph we can figure out in which neighborhood we have most no. of AirBnb listings and in which neighborhood we have less no. Of listing. So by using the business strategies we can distribute AirBnb listings in a proper manner - organized and systematic equal availability of rooms.

### 3.By the analysis of chart 3 We can infer that the shared rooms are available for the most days throughout 365 days. But we know that from chart 1 shared rooms availability is less. So by using our business strategies we can increase both the listing and their availability throughout 365 days.

### 4.By 4th chart, we can see that no. of reviews for private rooms are higher. So we can increase their listing and provide them at discounted prices which is another marketing strategy.

### 5.By the 5th chart, we can conclude that in neighborhoods like Staten Island, our properties are available for more time in 365 days. And neighbourhood like Brooklyn have AirBnbs that are available for lesser duration. Hence, we should focus on more properties to be listed in areas that lack in providing availability for 365 days.

### 6.By the 6th chart we can see that customers are more active in the price range of 1000-2000. That's why we will try to provide the best products in the desired price range.

### 7.From the 7th chart, we can see the distribution of different room type in different neighbourhood and we can use this analysis for increasing our business sales. We can provide more listings for areas that have less properties.

### 8.By 8th chart, we can infer which type of rooms are available for a minimum 1 night. However private rooms are available for a higher amount for 1 night. So we need to make sure all our other products also have the same or minimum night stay

### 9.From the 9th graph, we know that in a particular neighborhood there are certain price ranges for 1 night that we can provide so the customers can budget accordingly. This way we can coordinate with both the customer and the host to negotiate their prices accordingly.

### 10.By 10th chart, we can find out how many AirBnbs are available in each of the neighborhoods. That way we can increase our listings in neighborhoods that have less listings and organize the ones that are more in number.

### 11.From 11th graph, we can infer which type of rooms are available in different neighborhoods and which type of rooms should be increased to accommodate more customers in those neighborhoods (Shared rooms are available in less number so we can focus on increasing those)

### 12.In the 12th chart, we can find the price range of a particular room type for 1 night and we can manipulate the prices according to customers' requirements.

### 13.From the 13th graph, we can find out which neighborhood has pricing high or low for 1 night. However Manhattan has slightly higher pricing than the others. So we can increase the listings in Manhattan with lesser prices.
